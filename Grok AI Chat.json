{"version":"5.3.2","short_notes":"‣ New Shortcut Announcement!","long_notes":"Hey everyone! I don't really have any new updates for this version of Grok AI Chat, but I just wanted to ask, have you ever wondered why I have never added the model grok-code-fast-1 as a usable model in Grok AI Chat? \n\nWell, a small part of it may be because it does not have any access to the Agentic Tools, or because the model alias does not support \"-latest\" at the end, but the biggest reason is that ever since that model came out, I have been dreaming of making one thing: A full HTML code editor that is powered by grok-code-fast-1.\n\nAnd I'm very proud to announce that today, I have created just that! I just published my brand new Grok Code shortcut, which functions as a full multi-tab syntax-highlighted AI-powered code editor, right in your browser! You can find it at the link https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/24965\/. I hope you guys enjoy!\n\nP.S. Grok 4.20 is coming to the xAI API soon! I will definitely try to add it to this shortcut immediately as soon as it does ;)","routinehub_id":"21828","date":"February 25, 2026"}
