{"version":"5.3","short_notes":"‣ New Grok Imagine Models with image editing and video generation!\n‣ Bug fixes and improvements.","long_notes":"Hey everyone! I have a big update for you today! May I present the brand new Grok Imagine models, now on the xAI API! There are three new models, two for image generation and editing (grok-imagine-image and grok-imagine-image-pro) and one for video generation (grok-imagine-video). The new features in this shortcut include the ability to edit images with Grok and generate videos! I also improved the chat setup for the users that opted to use the free Grok App version of the shortcut, and, as is the norm, I fixed as many bugs as I encountered while adding all these updates (which was a lot). I hope you enjoy! Image editing and video generation features are coming to Grok AI Nano soon!","routinehub_id":"21828","date":"February 9, 2026"}
