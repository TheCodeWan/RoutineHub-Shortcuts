# RoutineHub-Shortcuts
The JSON update files for my Shortcuts

Currently a work in progress, not complete

Each shortcut's file has 5 keys:

- **version**: The latest version that was released
- **date**: The date the last version was released
- **short_notes**: The short description of the changes I made
- **long_notes**: The longer description of the changes I made
- **routinehub_id**: The id of the shortcut on RoutineHub. You can access the shortcut's page on RoutineHub by navigating to the url `https://routinehub.co/shortcut/{routinehub_id}`
- **url**: In the rare instance that the shortcut is not actually posted on RoutineHub, I will include a direct iCloud link to the shortcut instead.
